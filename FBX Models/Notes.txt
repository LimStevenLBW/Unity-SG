Create a new diffuse material and add the face texture to it to deal with lack of transparency(black texture)

bake axis conversions to deal with offcentered animations


export
no leaf bones


To create a new smart uv project, dont forget to apply skin modifier, otherwise it wont have any faces to map

eevee does not support texture baking, change bake type to diffuse to avoid lighting changes, turn off direct and indirect



We need to disable ACTIONS in the FBX to reduce filesize:
. To reduce the file size, turn off the exporting of any parts you do not want and disable All Actions
For armature animations typically you just leave the armature enabled which is necessary for that type of animation.
 Reducing what is output makes the export and future import much faster.
